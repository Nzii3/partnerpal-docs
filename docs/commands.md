# Commands List

Sentry's prefix can be customizable via <Link className={classnames("button button--outline button--primary button--small")} to="premium">Custom Punishments</Link>. The bot also listens to it's mention as a prefix, so you can do `@Sentry prefix` to view the server's prefix or even `@Sentry help` to view the help command.

:::tip
An argument surrounded in paranthesis: `(@member)` means the argument is **optional**

An argument surrounded in angle branckets: `<@member>` means the argument is **required** for a command to function
