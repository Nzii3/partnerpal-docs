# Cases

Cases enable you to observe all moderation instances and actions within a server, whether ongoing or past occurrences, and also provide the capability to modify and manage your cases. They are never deleted automatically (only by user request via the **Delete** button) ensuring they are always there for future reference.

## Viewing a Case
To view a case, use `>case [case_id]`. The `case_id` argument is optional as if none is provided, the bot will pull up the most recently created case.
